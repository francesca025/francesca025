# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Francesca

an astrophysicist from Malta, and I'm passionate about unravelling the mysteries surrounding our home in the Universe - the Milky Way - through my research on galaxies and their constituent stars. I graduated with a BSc. in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Malta, and am currently pursuing an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Astrophysics and Space Science (<a href="https://www.master-mass.eu/">MASS</a>), funded by an EMJM scholarship. After doing my first semester at the University of Rome â€˜Tor Vergataâ€™ in Italy, and my second semester at the University of Belgrade in Serbia, I am currently following third semester courses, and working on a research internship at the University of Belgrade in remote collaboration with the University of Rome â€˜Tor Vergataâ€™, as well as CÃ´te d'Azur University in France.
