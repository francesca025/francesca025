# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Francesca,

an astrophysicist from Malta, and I study galaxies. I obtained my BSc. in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Malta, and am currently pursuing an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master in Astrophysics and Space Science ( <a href="https://www.master-mass.eu/">MASS</a>), funded by an EMJM scholarship. After doing my first semester at the University of Rome â€˜Tor Vergataâ€™ in Italy, and my second semester at the University of Belgrade in Serbia, I am currently following third semester courses, and working on a research internship at the University of Belgrade.
